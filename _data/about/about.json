    "My sister introduced me to the original \"Spyro The Dragon\" when I was a toddler, and I've been hooked on video games ever since! I started PC gaming in middle school, and shortly after this I discovered the modding scene. What began as Team Fortress 2 level design in the Source SDK grew into a passion for developing video games from the ground up, and my love of math and technology in school meant that programming was the perfect path for me.",
