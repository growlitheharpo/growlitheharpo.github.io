    "blurb": "Less of a game and more of a tech demo, this downloadable piece is an interactive demonstration of my interpretation of Context Behaviors as described by Andrew Frey. This was part of the AI \"research\" project, where we were able to dive into any topic in game AI, whether we had covered it in class or not, and create a demo. I chose to look deeper into Steering Behaviors and alternatives to Steering, and found this really cool topic that I am looking forward to using in a real game project.",
