When it comes to artists I love that nobody has ever heard of, Emperor X may win the "Most Obscure" award. While it's certainly rare to meet someone who displays Okkervil River tour posters or sports The Airborne Toxic Event t-shirts, I've managed to bump into a few fellow fans scattered around. But never Emperor X, which is why I feel compelled to write about the gem that is the 2010 LP *Western Teleport*.

On *Western Teleport*, Emperor X engages in a rich form of lyrical world-building. Fictional and factual elements are weaved throughout. We travel from L.A. to Detroit, make a quick stop in rural Pakistan, and are finally delivered by the closer to the Matthews Bridge in Jacksonville, FL. *Allahu Akbar* invokes Islam and the Chechen Wars in the same breath as the [Arakeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrakis), a fictional people from the Dune series by Frank Herbert. The brief vignettes and hooks we are afforded give us glimpses of what seems to be a society, or perhaps a whole world, unraveling. Rebellion, anger, and confusion fill these scenes, from "blowing isotopes on the Harbor Freeway" in *Sig Alert* and "[throwing] a brick with a note through the ticket counter window" in *Canada Day*, to the seemingly bloody aftermath of it all with "broken hands reaching out through the stones" in the penultimate track, *Sincerely, H. C. Pregerson*.

All of this doom and gloom is both enhanced and contrasted by the music itself, which is often energetic and even upbeat in the face of the lyrics. The opener, *Erica Western Teleport*, greets us with a fun synth riff, "oohs" and "aahs", claps and stomps while our narrator pleads with us in desperation: "don't think of her." And this is perhaps the most light-hearted song on the album. The intentionally lo-fi mix gives the whole experience an air of unintentionality, almost like a movie in the "found-film" genre. It's as if these songs were found raw in the ruins where our narrator's "her" has lost her taser; the songs themselves, a message from a destroyed world.

In *Sig Alert*, the chaos begins to unfold. The aggressive, slightly syncopated, jangling intro prepares us for a lyrical whirlwind where we're deployed, knock out street lights, throw grenades, and debate whether to blow those aforementioned isotopes--though doing so would form counter-productive debris. Like on *Erica Western Teleport*, part of what makes Emperor X's approach to lyrics so engaging is the willingness to pivot on a dime between the macro, the political, the worldly--and then suddenly the personal. This angry, destructive anthem ends suddenly with the line: "Your girlfriend laughs at the tag on your sleeve."

The next few tracks proceed in kind (not to imply they ever become boring or "samey" because nothing could be further from the truth). *Canada Day* finds us smashing ticket counter windows and running from the cops. By the end, we are screaming because they are draining the lake and turning the fountains off. *A Violent Translation of the Concordia Headscarp* and *The Magnetic Media Storage Practices of Rural Pakistan* are both relatively short songs with quite long titles, and both continue this pattern of seemingly massive events contrasted with the intimately personal. Landslides, poverty, disasters - and an elderly loved one whose "voice is gone."

Eventually we find ourselves at *Sincerely, H. C. Pregerson* which is nothing short of a masterpiece and exemplifies this style of songwriting. I will refrain from simply reproducing the lyrics in their entirety here, but I need to call out at least a few.

> I'm encased in your numb arms<br>
> In the clutch of tollway sludge<br>
> I'm infected and you're not<br>

We know immediately that something is deeply wrong on multiple levels. A semi-nonsense phrase like "the clutch of tollway sludge" prevents us from getting an exact mental image, but to me that envokes decay and rubble--infrastructure collapsing. And then it is capped with a deeply personal situation, which unfortunately hits far closer to home here in 2020 than it could've hoped to in 2010.

> Try to cut yourself more tape<br>
> Pull it off -- infection's worse<br>
> [...]<br>
> And secretly, precociously, scratch 'til it blisters<br>


I say narrator, but Emperor X is not telling a specific story here, and the songs, while thematically tied, do not constitute a narrative. We just see glimpses and aftermaths.
