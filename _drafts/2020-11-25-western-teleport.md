When it comes to artists I love that nobody has ever heard of, Emperor X may win the "Most Obscure" award. While it's certainly rare to meet someone who hangs up Okkervil River tour posters or rocks The Airborne Toxic Event t-shirts, I've managed to bump into  a few fellow fans scattered around. But never Emperor X, which is why I feel compelled to write about the gem that is the 2010 LP *Western Teleport*.

On *Western Teleport*, Emperor X is mostly interested in world-building. Fictional and factual elements are weaved throughout. We travel from L.A. to Detroit and finally end up at the Matthews Bridge in Jacksonville, FL in the closing song. *Allahu Akbar* invokes Islam (of course) and the Chechen Wars in the same breath as the [Arakeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrakis), a fictional people from the Dune series by Frank Herbert. Brief vignettes and mysterious hooks give us insight into what seems to be a society unraveling. Rebellion, anger, and confusion permeate the scenes that Emperor X builds; from "blowing isotopes on the Harbor Freeway" in *Sig Alert* and "[throwing] a brick with a note through the ticket counter window" in *Canada Day*, to the seemingly bloody aftermath with "broken hands reaching out through the stones" in the penultimate track, *Sincerely, H. C. Pregerson*.

All of this doom and gloom is both enhanced and contrasted by the music itself, which is often energetic and even upbeat in the face of the lyrics. The opener, *Erica Western Teleport*, greets us with a fun synth riff, "oohs" and "aahs", claps and stomps while our narrator desperately pleads with us: "don't think of her." The intentionally lo-fi mix gives the whole experience a sense of unintentionality, almost like a "found-film" movie. It's as if these songs were found raw in the ruins where our narrator's "her" has lost her taser; the songs themselves a message from a destroyed world.

I say narrator, but Emperor X is not telling a specific story here, and the songs, while thematically tied, do not constitute a narrative. We just see glimpses and aftermaths.
