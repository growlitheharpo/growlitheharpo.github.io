Hello!

I am very excited to apply to the <role> at <location>. I am a systems and performance-focused programmer with several years of game industry experience, and I am looking for a new creative challenge.

VERSION 1 (less low-level): As I said, my experience at Blizzard has been largely focused on engine-level work. I was lucky enough to be a member of the Diablo II: Resurrected team from the very start of the project. This is a remaster of the classic Diablo II, and being part of the team from the start has given me the opportunity to work on fundamental elements of its new 3D engine. For example, I designed and implemented our render graph, a zero-allocation system which schedules CPU-side graphics work on multiple threads based on algorithmically-determined dependencies and handles correct synchronization of shared GPU resources. I am also the owner of the "Translation Layer", our system that converts events and information from the underlying 2D game engine into structures the 3D game understands. This system is critical to our desired player experience. We are running the entire original Diablo II "underneath" and the Translation Layer allows the newly remastered HD gameplay to perfectly match that. My work on this system has involved close collaboration with other programmers, designers, and artists. As this is a cross-platform release, I also have experience debugging, profiling, and optimizing code on all current and next-gen consoles as well as PC.

VERSION 2 (more low-level): My experience at Vicarious Visions (now part of Blizzard Entertainment) has been largely focused on engine level work. I was lucky enough to be a member of the Diablo II: Resurrected team from the very start of the project, which has given me the opportunity to work on fundamental elements of its new 3D engine. For example, I designed and implemented the job/task system, which enables the entire team to easily write safe, multithreaded code. I also designed and implemented our render graph. This is a zero-allocation system that schedules CPU-side graphics work on multiple threads based on automatically-determined dependencies and handles correct synchronization of shared GPU resources. I have experience debugging, profiling, and optimizing code on all current and next-gen consoles as well as PC. My work always involves close collaboration with other programmers, designers, and artists to ensure that content remains in-budget without ever compromising the player's experience.
