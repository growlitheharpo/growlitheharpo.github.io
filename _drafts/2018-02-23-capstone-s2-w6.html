                <p>I'm writing this week's blog post in a bit of a hurry, so unfortunately we won't have as many visuals
                    as usual. Here's what I accomplished last week:<br></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementing two new weapon parts: the "X-ray/tag" sight, and the "laser" mechanism<br></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>The "tag" sight was implemented as a special Aim-Down-Sights effect; essentially, after aiming at a
                    player for a certain amount of time, they are drawn with a yellow outline around them that is
                    visible through walls. This required the use of CommandBuffers in Unity and a lot of time spent in
                    shaders. Overall, the effect came out nice.<br></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>The laser mechanism required a modification to our core hitscan projectile code. The idea for lasers
                    was that they would be able to hit players through walls. As such, hitscan projectiles now have the
                    ability to travel through a certain number of static objects and a certain number of target objects,
                    both of which are designer-tweakable in the inspector.<br></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementing a new third-person model and hitboxes, and first-person animations<br></li>

                <p>The new shader I wrote for colormasking last week for the first-person hand was reused for the
                    third-person model that Tyler has redone. During the process of implementing the new model (and
                    animations coming next sprint!), we also added hitboxes and damage modification to finally allow for
                    headshots to do extra damage. This is something that players have been wanting for a very, very long
                    time, so I'm glad I finally had a chance to add it.<br></p>

        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>I also helped support Tyler by implementing some of the new first-person animations, which include
                    responses of the hand to recoil and fire-rate. It's been a little difficult so far, but we are
                    working through making sure that all the animations look good for all the part combinations.<br></p>

        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>Tyler provided an emissive texture map with all of the new weapon part models that have been
                    implemented. This emissive section lerps from a desaturated green to a bright red and then blinks as
                    each part's durability falls and it eventually breaks. This effect has so far helped QA testers
                    understand durability significantly better, since the effect is large and obvious in their viewport
                    instead of being relegated to a UI element.<br></p>
