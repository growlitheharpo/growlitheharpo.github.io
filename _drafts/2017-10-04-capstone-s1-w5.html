                <p>During our last class, we successfully challenged Initial Concepts and are thus now in the Deep Dive
                    stage! Of our three prototypes, we decided to move forward with the Arena game, with one important
                    change: QA feedback was nearly unanimous that the splitscreen controller-based version was not
                    cutting it for players. Thus, the first thing we did this sprint was one of the biggest challenges
                    we've faced as a team yet: networking the game.</p>

                <p>To start off with, it’s important to note that this first pass of the networking for Modulate is
                    meant to be placeholder and temporary, and was implemented primarily to prove the viability of the
                    concept and to get QA feedback. Currently, far too much is decided on the client side, which is
                    concerning for any game where players are against each other, both for cheat prevention and lag
                    compensation. With that in mind, here’s how the networking has taken shape thus far:</p>

            <div>
                <p>The first thing to do was to get players moving around in the same place. To that end, I set up the
                    NetworkManager provided by Unity and added a NetworkTransform component, and changed our primary
                    Player script to be a NetworkBehaviour instead of a MonoBehaviour and made the necessary tweaks
                    (such as ensuring input is only collected on the local client). It’s important to note that at this
                    point, the player object is entirely client-authoritative, and the only value synced over the
                    network is the Transform component.</p>

        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>The next step was to get weapons to shoot over the network. For this early prototype, each client
                    simply sends the server a Ray (consisting of a Vector3 origin and Vector3 direction) for each shot
                    fired when it occurs, and the server broadcasts this to all clients (without verification) who then
                    recreate the shot on their end. Currently, each client is responsible for tracking its own health
                    and calculating damage from the shots received from other players. The client then notifies the
                    server when their health has reached 0 and they have died, which the server then broadcasts to all
                    other clients.</p>

                            <p>After getting weapon firing and player deaths working, the next step was to sync weapon
                                part pickup events across the server. Again, we are not yet using a server-authoritative
                                system like we should be quite yet, for the prototyping and demoing stage. Instead, we
                                follow a system much like is demonstrated in the whiteboard diagram I drew (pictured
                                here) while trying to figure out how to get this working quickly. Essentially, the
                                weapon parts that rain down from the sky are created on the server and networked to all
                                clients. Then, when a client calls “pick-up” on one of them, the original item is
                                destroyed and an RPC is called on all local copies of that client to equip whatever part
                                was grabbed. In other words, the actual state of the weapon is not fully networked, and
                                the server is not authoritative on the matter; if a client misses an equip event, they
                                will have the wrong weapon part for one of the other players in the game.<br></p>

                    <p>The final step in networking (discounting simple things like the score and match timer) was
                        getting the “gravity gun” hand working. This proved to be the trickiest part and is something I
                        am still not sure how to implement going forward. The trick with the gravity gun is that it must
                        affect physics objects (the falling and fallen weapon parts) using physics forces, but then
                        transition those objects to a non-physics-driven state when within a certain range, all with
                        smooth motion on all clients. The behaviour of the “gravity gun” is also very heavily dependent
                        on input state. The original, single-player version of the gun was a finite state machine with
                        transitions decided almost exclusively by changes in input--something that does not work as well
                        when networked.</p>

                        (as well as an action game rather than a stealth game), the approach to recoil and dispersion in
                        particular were very interesting to us. Some important changes were:</p>

                        (JetBrains’ Rider OR Visual Studio 2017 with ReSharper), and our version control choice (git for
                        our development repository, with a school-wide standardized SVN build server). Four pages are
