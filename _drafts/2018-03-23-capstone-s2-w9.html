                <p>Unfortunately, due to a technology limitation, there won't be many screenshots or videos again this
                    week. But I'll briefly discuss some things that have changed since the last blog post and some
                    challenges along the way!</p>

            <div>
                <p>One of the first things you'll see the next time a video is posted is that the player's magnet arm
                    has animations and an actual visual presence on-screen now. Having this extra visual feedback for
                    such a core mechanic was really important and the response at QA has been very positive. Weâ€™ve also
                    slightly reworked the controls of the magnet arm to align with what people have been saying at QA;
                    previously, everything was all on one button (E), but now dropping has been moved to a separate
                    button (Q).</p>

        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>We've also given the scoreboard at the end a major overhaul. <span
                        style="background-color: transparent">The previous iteration was actually a hold-over from a
                        long, long time ago when the game was two-player split screen. It's been given minor
                        functionality tweaks since then, but was never really brought into the newest iteration of the
                        game. Charlie, the lead designer, and I worked closely together to try and create something that
                        fits the current feel of the game. This is what we arrived at:</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div style="max-width: 100%;text-align:center;"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/capstone/s2w9_scorecard.png"
                    style="max-width:100%;width: 100%;"> </div>
        </div>
        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>I also worked with our lead artist, Tyler, on adding a death "animation" to the players. Now, instead
                    of simply disappearing into a cloud of placeholder triangle particles, the robot's body falls apart
                    into pieces, and a lighting effect plays. It's much more satisfying, and I can't wait to capture
                    some video to show it off. It's added a whole world of feel to re[Mod].</p>

            <div>
                <p>To fully utilize the above scoreboard, we also had to implement the score system that we've had
                    planned for a while. Players get points for:</p>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting kills</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extra points for headshots, multi-kills, killstreaks, and breaking other players killstreaks
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Capturing stage areas</li>
                    <li>Equipping legendary parts</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="elementTextWrapper">
            <div>
                <p>This involved new event tracking systems on the server-side of the game, as well as the UI changes
                    necessary to inform players as they were gaining points. This has had a massive effect at QA, where
                    players are having more fun than ever and finally starting to see the value of team-based
                    play.&nbsp; I also implemented several fixes and improvements to team-based play, including fixing a
                    bug where teammates would sometimes block you from capturing a stage, and ensuring players know
                    which team is capturing.</p>

                <p>In order to segue them from the lobby area into their teams, we've also added the following intro
