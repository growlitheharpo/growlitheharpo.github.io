                <p>I wasn't totally sure how to title this post. It's Week 1 of the second semester of <a
                        href="/portfolio/remod.html" target="_self" title="re[Mod]">re[Mod]</a>, and we're gearing up to
                    take this project from its current pre-production state to something final and complete by the end
                    of April.</p>

                    <p>Over the break, we made a lot of plans for how we want to improve and finish this game. Some of
                        them are a little loftier than others. Our ideas include up to 20 new weapon parts, three
                        potential game modes, different maps for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 player games, and a suite of
                        environment and narrative changes. There are also several backend changes that I would like to
                        make, including a total overhaul of how players find and connect to games. I am very excited to
                        work on a "lobby" feature later in the semester that will allow players without any familiarity
                        with the game to pick it up and play.<br></p>

                    <p>This first week is going to be focused on largely behind-the-scenes items though, including the
                        ability to quit and join multiple matches without having to restart the executable. There was
                        previously a bug in the way the NetworkManager was being cleaned up and reset between scene
                        loads/reloads, with the result being that trying to join multiple games would leave the player
                        stuck on a "Connecting..." screen without any way to get out of it. This turned out to be
                        extremely simple to solve, but just hadn't been a priority last semester when we were focused on
                        getting a playable prototype ready.<br></p>

                    <p>This week is also the first real week of work for the newest members of the team, and it's going
                        to be an interesting challenge getting them all up-to-date and into the flow that our team uses.
                        I am confident that by the end of the semester, we're going to have some great things done!</p>
