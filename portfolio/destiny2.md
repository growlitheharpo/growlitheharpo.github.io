Destiny 2 is an online shared-world first-person shooter. It is primary developed by Bungie. As a Junior Software Engineer at VV, I worked on a collaborative, high-caliber team helping Bungie to expand the Destiny franchise. I worked on Destiny 2 towards the tail-end of Vicarious Visions' involvement in the series. By this time, it was already a live game on the three major platforms with a global playerbase. I primarily worked on the South Korean release, [Destiny: Guardians](https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/5/17537908/destiny-2-guardians-korea-eververse-tess-yuna). My focuses included:
* UI engineering, helping to ensure content creators had all the tools they needed to make engaging, intuitive, and gorgeous UI.
* Assisting making changes to the base game (including gameplay and UI work) that were required to ship Destiny: Guardians in the South Korean market.
* Improving engineering and content creator workflows by speeding up development build access to internal Battle.net servers.
